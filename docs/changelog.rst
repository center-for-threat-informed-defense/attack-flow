Attack Flow 2
-------------

2.0.0 -- October 27th, 2022
    This major update to Attack Flow is based on community feedback from Attack Flow 1
    and extensive collaboration with `our research partners
    <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-flow/>`__. The major improvements
    include:

    * The new specification is based on STIX 2.1 and addresses known limitations and
      feedback on the Attack Flow 1 specification.
    * Completely overhauled Attack Flow Builder tool: more powerful and more
      user-friendly.
    * Greatly expanded the documentation (you're reading it right now!) to provide a
      better ramp up for learning Attack Flow as well as more depth when you're ready to
      become an Attack Flow expert.
    * Added a dozen new attack flows to the public corpus. These flows are useful for
      learning Attack Flow, for evaluating future changes to the Attack Flow
      specification, and data mining.

    *This release is not backwards-compatible with 1.0.0.*

Attack Flow 1
-------------

1.0.0 -- March 2nd, 2022
    The initial release of Attack Flow contains a specification for a machine-readable
    specification for describing sequences (or more generally "graphs") of adversary
    behaviors. The release also contains a web application for creating attack flows
    visually as well as Python library code for validating flows.
