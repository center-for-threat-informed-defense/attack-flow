Best Practices Guide
====================

This chapter addresses considerations for creating flows that are outside the scope of
the technical specification. While it is possible to create a valid flow without
adhering to these rules, we recommend employing these best practices to produce
high-quality flows.

Project Name
------------

The technical specification and the project as a whole are referred to as "Attack Flow"
(with capital letters), while the individual files created using the language are
referred to as "attack flows" (lower case).

Open-Source Report Selection
----------------------------

If you choose to use an open-source report to create an attack flow, it is important to
assess the strengths and weaknesses of the report in order to establish a confidence
level in its data and assessments. Factors affecting source quality include the manner
of data collection, the level of source access to the data, report completeness, and the
age and currency of the information. In addition to extracting the technical details, it
is also beneficial to construct the victimology of the attack from the reports, as its
inclusion will allow any reader to quickly gauge the scope and applicability of the flow
to their own organization. It is important to use high-quality sources, because they
will support the credibility of your flow and provide an accurate portrayal of the
threat, which may be used to inform decisions on defense and resource prioritization.

   **Key Takeaways for Selecting a Report**

   * Reports should be transparent about where the data originates and provide a
     technically competent overview of an incident.
   * Reports should originate from a vendor with a track record of accurate reporting
     and first-hand analysis of the incident in question.
   * Reports should provide the most current information on the malware or breach.
   * Reports should make it easy to identify any information gaps. Use multiple sources
     to address gaps and corroborate the data, if possible.
   * Reports should distinguish between facts, assumptions, and analytical assessments.
   * When available, use attribution and targeting information from reports to enrich
     your attack flows.

Conversely, sources that do not meet the above criteria should be avoided. Sources that
do not have technical expertise and the ability to analyze the malware or attack
themselves (for example, news sites) are not considered optimal for creating attack
flows.

Characteristics of Reports to Avoid:

* Second-hand sources that simply regurgitate information about attacks instead of providing their own technical analysis.
* Sources that do not provide the context in which the information was obtained.
* Reports focusing mainly on a security product rather than the attack.
* Sources that do not provide adequate technical information.

Examples of Reports to Avoid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloudflare: `"What are Petya and NotPetya?" <https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/petya-notpetya-ransomware>`_
     This article simply summarizes the attack and does not offer the technical detail
     needed to create a flow.

Vox: `"U.S. hospitals have been hit by the global ransomware attack" <https://www.vox.com/2017/6/27/15881666/global-eu-cyber-attack-us-hackers-nsa-hospitals>`_
     This news article does not have the source credibility and technical detail needed
     to create a flow.

Trellix: `"Update on WhisperGate, Destructive Malware Targeting Ukraine - Threat Intelligence & Protections Update" <https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/update-on-whispergate-destructive-malware-targeting-ukraine.html>`_
     This article focuses on mitigation strategies and tools rather than the technical
     details of the attack. However, the report bases its information on a technical
     report by Trellix, which would be a good source to create an attack flow.

Examples of Reports to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crowdstrike: `“NotPetya Technical Analysis -  A Triple Threat: File Encryption, MFT Encryption, Credential Theft” <https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/petrwrap-ransomware-technical-analysis-triple-threat-file-encryption-mft-encryption-credential-theft/>`_
     Crowdstrike performs a first-hand analysis of the NotPetya malware and provides a
     sufficient level of technical detail.

Cisco Talos: `"Ukraine Campaign Delivers Defacement and Wipers, in Continued Escalation" <https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement.html>`_
     Cisco performs a first-hand analysis of the WhisperGate malware and provides
     sufficient technical detail. This report also provides information on adversary
     intent, targeting, and attribution, and distinguishes between information and
     analytical judgements.

The DFIR Report: `"SEO Poisoning - A Gootloader Story" <https://thedfirreport.com/2022/05/09/seo-poisoning-a-gootloader-story/>`_
     DFIR performs a first-hand analysis of this attack and provides sufficient
     technical detail, including a detailed timeline of events.

.. note::

   The three examples in this section have all been mapped into attack flows in
   :doc:`example_flows`.

Mapping Reports to ATT&CK Techniques
------------------------------------

General Advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MITRE ATT&CK™ is a knowledge base observed adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
extracted from public threat reporting. There are hundreds of techniques in the ATT&CK
knowledge base, and it can be challenging to map CTI reports if you are not familiar
with the overall structure of ATT&CK.

.. attention::

   Attack Flow does not require the use of ATT&CK. You may use adversary techniques from
   other knowledge bases or even proprietary techniques that are not part of any public
   reporting.

Consider the following steps when mapping reports to ATT&CK techniques:

* Familiarize yourself with the `ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix <https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/>`_.
* Take MITRE's `MAD CTI Training
  <https://mitre.org/cybersecurity/mad/>`_ for deeper training.
* Read CISA's `best practices for mapping to ATT&CK
  <https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/Best%20Practices%20for%20MITRE%20ATTCK%20Mapping.pdf>`__.
* Read through your selected report(s) and try to order the behaviors into chronological
  events, beginning with Reconnaissance or Initial Access tactics and ending with the
  Impact of the attack.
* If the order of events is unclear in your report, you may need to compare several
  technical reports to determine a timeline.
* Once you have your order of events, assign a technique to each event. You may need to
  conduct further research on the behavior to determine the best-fitting technique.
* Use the Center for Threat-Informed Defenses `ATT&CK Powered Suit
  <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/attck-powered-suit/gfhomppaadldngjnmbefmmiokgefjddd?hl=en&authuser=0>`_
  browser extension to quickly research ATT&CK techniques, groups, and more.
* Set the confidence property in your actions to reflect any potential uncertainty in
  your sources.

Example Technique Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section works through an example of mapping a report to illustrate the process. The
report used is from Cisco Talos: `"Iranian APT MuddyWater targets Turkish users via
malicious PDFs, executables"
<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/iranian-apt-muddywater-targets-turkey.html>`_.
The corresponding "Muddy Water" Attack Flow can be found in :doc:`example_flows`. The
"Muddy Water" Attack Flow has some additional details and depicts two variants of the
Muddy Water beahvior. This section is based on the older variant of Muddy Water
campaigns.

**Initial Access**

The adversary gains initial access to the system through the distribution of PDF files
containing embedded links.

.. image:: _static/SpearPhishing.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report underlining the sentence "...it is highly likely that the PDFs served as the initial entry points to the attack and were distributed via email messages as part of spear-phishing efforts conducted by the group." The sentence is labeled with ATT&CK technique T1566.001 SpearPhishing Attachment.

**Execution**

The malware requires user-interaction to execute.

.. image:: _static/MaliciousLink.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report of the Infection Chain section. It underlines the sentence "The PDF files typically show an error message and ask the user to click on a link." The sentence is labeled with ATT&CK technique T1204.001 User Execution: Malicious Link.

**Command and Control**

This report downloads two variants of the infection chain. The PDF either downloads
malicious XLS files or a Windows executable from an attacker-hosted website. In an
attack flow, multiple paths would be passed using an operator "OR"/"AND." However, for
the sake of this example, we will only map the first variation.

.. image:: _static/IngressTool.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report of the Malicious Executables-Based Infection Chain section. It underlines the sentence "The URLs corresponding to the download button in the PDF files will typically host the malicious XLS files containing the macros that deploy the subsequent VBS and powershell scripts." The sentence is labeled with ATT&CK technique T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Infection Chain**

The malicious XLS file variation executes via VBA macros and establishes persistence.

.. image:: _static/VBAMacros.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report of the Persistence section with five techniques labeled. The first technique is T1059.005 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic drawn from the sentence "The infection chain instrumented by the VBA macros consists of three key artifacts..." The second technique is T1059.005 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic drawn from the bullet stating that one of the artifacts is the malicious VB script intermediate component that the macro sets up for persistence. The third technique is T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell drawn from the bullet stating that one of the artifacts is a malicious PowerShell-based downloader script. The fourth technique is T1547.001 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder drawn from the sentence "...persistence is set up by creating a malicious Registry run for the infected user." The final technique is T1218 System Binary Process Execution drawn from the sentence "This campaign relies on the use of a LoLBin to execute the malicious VBScript."

There was no ATT&CK technique associated with this Canary Token technique that may have
served as a means of defense evasion or anti-analysis. The action was simply named
"Canary Token Execution."

.. image:: _static/CanaryToken.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report from the Tracking Tokens section underlining the sentence "The latest versions of the VBA code deployed could make HTTP requests to a canary tooken from canarytokens.com." The extracted technique is simply labeled "Canary Token Execution."

This variation of the malware concludes with the PowerShell downloader reaching out to a
remote location for the final payload, which Cisco was unable to obtain.

.. image:: _static/PowerShell.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report of the Malicious Powershell-Based Downloader section with two techniques extracted. The first technique is T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer drawn from the sentence "The PowerShell script that downloads another PowerShell from a remote location which will then be executed." The second technique is T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Powershell, which is also drawn from the same sentence.

**Impact**

Because Cisco was unable to obtain the final payload, we cannot determine the objective
of the attack. However, we can assess possible impact based on information in the report
on Muddy Water's observed behavior in past campaigns. We will reflect this uncertainty
in our flow in the Action descriptions and confidence property and by using an OR
operator.

.. image:: _static/Impact.png
   :alt: Screenshot from Cisco report of the MuddyWater Threat Actor section. The section says "Campaigns carried out by the threat actor aim to achieve either of three outcomes." Each outcome is underlined: Espionage, Intellectual Property Theft, and Ransomware attacks. The three techniques labeled correspond to those outcomes and are TA0009 Collection, TA0010 Exfiltration, and T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact.

Flow Structure
--------------

The following best practices pertain to how the individual objects are arranged together
to form an attack flow.

**Begin a flow with either a Reconnaissance, Resource Development, or Initial Access
Technique.** If the Initial Access vector is unknown, begin the flow with a condition
stating that the Initial Access vector is unknown, along with any other details on the
compromised state of the system. If there are multiple possible Initial Access vectors,
combine them using an OR operator.

**Use preconditions to enhance human understanding of the flow.** If a set of actions are self-explanatory, omit the precondition and connect the actions to each other directly. For example, the NotPetya encryption routine does not require preconditions in between the actions.

.. figure:: _static/notpetya-excerpt.png
   :alt: An excerpt from the NotPetya flow. A scheduled task action to reboot the machine leads to the rebooting action.
   :align: center

   A condition object is not necessary between these actions because the relationship
   between is very obvious.

**End a flow with an Impact technique.** If the Impact is unknown, end the flow with condition stating that the impact is unknown, along with any other relevant details.

Flow Data
---------

**The description field for the flow is open-ended but should bring context and
relevance to the flow.** For example, include information on attribution, targeted
company/industry/geography, specific technologies targeted, etc. This helps readers can quickly gauge the relevance of the attack to their own assets. You may
also want to include lessons learned, IOCs, or any other information that will inform
threat prioritization and decision-making.

**Action descriptions should provide sufficient detail and not simply repeat the
technique name.** For example, "Exploits remote services," is a poor description because
it is a rephrasing of a technique name. A better description would be, "to move
laterally, NotPetya tests for vulnerable SMBv1 condition (Eternal Blue/Eternal Romance
exploit) and deploys an SMB backdoor.""

**Refrain from attaching conditions directly to other conditions.** Although the
specification does not forbid this, it is duplicative and wastes space. Consider
combining the two conditions into one object with a description that describes both
aspects of the state.

Quality Criteria for Public Corpus
----------------------------------

The project includes a number of :doc:`example_flows`. We encourage you to submit flows
you create for inclusion in this public corpus. Additions to the public corpus should
follow the best practices described above as well as meet the following requirements:

1. The flow must be sufficiently complex for submission. The flow must have no fewer
   than 10 actions and must make proper use of preconditions and operators.
2. The flow must contain at least one source in the metadata. Source must be credible
   and technically competent.
