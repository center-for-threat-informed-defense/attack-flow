# Attack Flow Format

Attack Flow represents the linkage of adversary behavior for a given attack flow . 

The type, description, and required attributes of each field are provided in the subsequent sections along with an example.

TODO: Visual for the Attack Flow model / Data Dictionary.

## Data Dictionary
### Top Level Metadata Fields
 
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| type | String | yes | One of `attack-flow` or `attack-flow-pattern` to indicate the type of this Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| id | String | yes | The UUID-formatted identifier for this Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| name | String | yes | The name of the Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| version | String | yes | The version of the Attack Flow format used in this file. Currently `dev`. |
| created | Timestamp | yes | Creation time of the Attack Flow or Pattern.<br /> Format:  2021-01-01 |
| author | String | no | The author of the Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| description | String | no | The description of the Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| actions | List of Action objects | yes | The list of Action Nodes in the Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| assets | List of Asset objects | yes | The list of Asset Nodes in the Attack Flow or Pattern. |
| relationships | List of Relationship objects | yes | The list of Relationship Edges in the Attack Flow or Pattern. |

### Action object Fields
An action object describes a discrete action for one step in an attack flow(ex: ATT&CK technique).
 
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| type | String | yes | MUST be `action` |
| id | String | yes | The UUID-formatted id of the action. |
| name | String | yes | The name of the action. May be an ATT&CK technique name. |
| description | String | yes | A description of the action. |
| reference | String | no | A reference for the action. May be a URL to an ATT&CK technique. |
| properties | List of Strings | no | The list of properties associated with this action object. |
| succeeded | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| confidence | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| state | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### Asset object Fields
An asset object describes a resource or capability that is being acted on or is involved with an action object.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| type | String | yes | The type of the object. MUST be `action`. |
| id | String | yes | The UUID-formatted id of the action. |
| properties | List of Strings | no | The list of properties associated with the asset. |

### Relationship object Fields.
A relationship links an Action to an Object or an Object to an Action.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| type | String | yes | The type of the object. MUST be `relationship`. |
| id | String | yes | The UUID-formatted id of the relationship. |
| label | String | yes | The type of the relationship. e.g., `modifies` |
| source | String | yes | The source Action ID or Asset ID for this relationship. |
| destination | String | yes | The destination Asset ID or Action ID for this relationship. |

### Relationships

| Source | Label | Destination | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Action | actor_of | Asset | The person identified by the asset caused the action to happen |
