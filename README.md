# Attack Flow
Attack Flow helps executives, SOC managers, and defenders easily understand how attackers compose adversary techniques into attacks by developing a representation of attack flows, modeling attack flows for a small corpus of incidents, and creating visualization tools to display attack flows. 

At the end of the project, the visualization tools will demonstrate how attack flows will help security leaders explain defensive posture to executives, help defenders understand lessons-learned in an incident, and help red-teamers easily compose realistic adversary emulation scenarios.
