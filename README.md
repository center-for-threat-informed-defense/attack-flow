# Attack Flow

Attack Flow is a language for describing how cyber adversaries combine and sequence various offensive
techniques to achieve their goals. The project helps defenders and leaders understand how adversaries operate
and improve their own defensive posture. This project is created and maintained by the [MITRE Engenuity Center
for Threat-Informed Defense](https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/) in futherance of our mission to advance the
start of the art and and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded
by our [research participants](https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-flow/#RESEARCH-PARTICIPANTS).

## Getting Started

To get started, we suggest skimming the documentation to get familiar with the project. Next, you may want to try creating
your own attack flows using the Attack Flow Builder, which is an easy-to-use GUI tool. When you are ready to dive deep,
review the Example Flows and JSON Schema for the language.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Review the language specification, use the builder to create some flows, and tell us what you think.** We
  welcome your review and feedback on the data model and our methodology.
- **Help us prioritize additional example flows to create.** Let us know what examples you would like to
  turned into an Attack Flow. Your input will help us prioritize how we expand our corpus.
- **Share your use cases.** We are interested in developing additional tools and resources to help the
  community understand and make threat-informed decisions in their risk management programs. If you have ideas
  or suggestions, we consider them as we explore additional research projects.
