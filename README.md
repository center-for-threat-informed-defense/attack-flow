# Attack Flow
Attack Flow helps executives, SOC managers, and defenders easily understand how attackers compose adversary techniques into attacks by developing a representation of attack flows, modeling attack flows for a small corpus of incidents, and creating visualization tools to display attack flows.

At the end of the project, the visualization tools will demonstrate how attack flows will help security leaders explain defensive posture to executives, help defenders understand lessons-learned in an incident, and help red-teamers easily compose realistic adversary emulation scenarios.

Resources:
* [Attack Flow Specification](/docs/attack-flow-schema.md)
* [Attack Flow JSON Schema](/schema/attack-flow-2022-01-05-draft.json)
* [Attack Flow JSON Example Document](/schema/attack-flow-example.json)
* Attack Flow Designer: A GUI tool for building Attack Flows. (See "Getting Started".)

## Getting Started
Once you familiarize yourself with [the Attack Flow specification](/docs/attack-flow-schema.md), try using the
Attack Flow Designer GUI to view or create your own Attack Flow. To get started:

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow/releases) and
   download `attack_flow_designer.zip` as well as `corpus.zip`.
2. Unzip these two files.
3. In the `attack_flow_builder` directory, double click on `index.html` to open it in a web browser.
4. Inside the Attack Flow Designer, go to File → Open Attack Flow. Navigate to the `corpus` directory and
   open one of the `*.afd` files.
5. To create your own Attack Flow, refresh the page. Right-click in the Attack Flow workspace to create a
   node. Drag and drop from the plug icon to connect nodes together (subject to the rules of the Attack Flow
   specification).
6. Save your Attack Flow in one of two formats:
    1. File → Save Attack Flow: saves the file with `*.afd` extension. This file is suitable for opening up
       for editing in the Attack Flow Designer.
    2. File → Publish Attack Flow: saves a `*.json` file that conforms to the Attack Flow specification; this
       file is interoperable with other Attack Flow tools.
